abstract = "Cayley hash values are defined by paths of some oriented graphs (quivers) called Cayley graphs, whose vertices and arrows are given by elements of a group H. On the other hand, Brauer messages are obtained by concatenating words associated with multisets constituting some configurations called Brauer configurations. These configurations define some oriented graphs named Brauer quivers which induce a particular class of bound quiver algebras named Brauer configuration algebras. Elements of multisets in Brauer configurations can be seen as letters of the Brauer messages. This paper proves that each point"
