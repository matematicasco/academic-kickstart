abstract = "The aim of this paper is to investigate a general notion of 𝜎-PBW extensions over Armendariz rings. As an application, the properties of Baer, quasi-Baer, p.p., and p.q.-Baer are established for these extensions. We generalize several results in the literature for Ore extensions of injective type and skew PBW extensions."
