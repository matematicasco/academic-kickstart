abstract = "Muscovy ducks (*Cairina moschata*) are one of the most exploited species in the duck-farming industry due to their large size, meat quality, and considerable economic value for small farmers and large factories. This study reviews the available information on its productive potential and the factors likely to impact it. Although this species can achieve high meat yields, not all management systems seem to be capable of obtaining ‘optimal’ growth, especially in developing countries. This situation occurs because the optimal weight of this duck is highly dependent on proper management conditions and its genetic background. Domestic production of male Muscovy ducks results in live weights ranging from 2.0 to 2.9 kg. When bred under improved conditions they can achieve a live weight ranging from 4.5 to 5.1 kg with an additional increase of up to 6.5 kg with a 2-week forced-feeding programme. Other producers utilise crossbreeding with Peking ducks to produce sterile mule ducks that have lower sexual dimorphism, adequate meat yields, and even superior foie gras yields. There have also been several studies on the use of natural supplements in these species; however, only some probiotics have shown an impact on productivity. Another important aspect when procuring adequate yields is to ensure the proper health of the individuals. Although Muscovy ducks are generally more resistant to pathogens than chickens, they are not exempt from suffering infections. They can be affected by several parasites such as nematodes that reduce their productivity and can lead to death in severe outbreaks. Viral infections can also lead to high mortalities and substantial economic losses such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (20–100% mortality), parvoviruses (10–90% mortality), reoviruses (10–53% mortality), and herpes viruses (10–100% mortality)."
