abstract = "In this work, we expand on the weak asymptotic analysis originally proposed in Abreu et al. (2024) for the investigation of scalar equations and systems of conservation laws, extending it to encompass scalar equations with nonlocal fluxes. Subsequently, we apply this refined methodology to explore a specific class of nonlocal scalar conservation laws"
