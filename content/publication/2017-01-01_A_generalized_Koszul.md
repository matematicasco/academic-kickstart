abstract = "Let R be a commutative algebra. In this paper, we show that constant skew PBW extensions of a generalized Koszul algebra R are also generalized Koszul. Let A be a semi-commutative skew PBW extension of R such that A is R-augmented. We show also that if R is augmented Koszul then A is R-augmented Koszul."
