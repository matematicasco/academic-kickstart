abstract = "In this work, we construct and analyze a new fully discrete Lagrangian-Eulerian numerical method for the treatment of dynamics of conservation laws with nonlocal flux and influence of the source term in the solution. The scheme is based on the improved concept of no-flow curves. We use the recent results of S. Blandin & P. Goatin (2016), [Numer. Math. 132, 217-241], to obtain a BV estimate for the new fully discrete (explicit) Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme with a rigorous analysis to prove its convergence for the entropic solution. We also derive a weak CFL-type stability condition that does not require the derivative of the nonlocal flux as is the case for classical schemes. As an application of the proposed approach, we present a combined analytical-numerical study on the interplay between local and nonlocal conservation laws motivated by dynamics of differential equations such as traffic flow and related problems. For a suitable exponential kernel 𝜔𝜂 of class 𝐶2, we present theoretical and numerical evidence that the limit of solutions to the nonlocal equation coincides with the unique entropy-admissible solution of the scalar conservation law 𝜌𝑡+(𝜌𝑚𝑣(𝑞))𝑥=0. It should be emphasized that hypotheses on the solution were verified numerically only. In this regard, the flux function 𝑓(𝜌)=𝜌𝑚𝑣(𝑞) satisfies 𝑞(𝑥,𝑡)=∫𝑥+𝜂𝑥𝜔𝜂(𝑥−𝑦)𝜌(𝑦,𝑡)𝑑𝑦, for an integer 1≤𝑚, where 𝜔𝜂 is unitary (integral equals to 1) and non-increasing kernel such that 𝜔𝜂(𝑠)=1(1−𝑒−1/𝜂2)𝜂2𝑒−𝑠/𝜂2 for every 𝑠∈ℝ. It turns out that we also use recent results of A. Bressan & W. Shen (2020), [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 237, 1213-1236] and A. Bressan & W. Shen (2021), [Communications in Mathematical Sciences 19(5) 1447 - 1450], as foundations of the Lagrangian-Eulerian approach for nonlocal conservation laws."
