abstract = "In this paper, we show that the tensor product of skew PBW extensions is a skew PBW extension. We also characterize the enveloping algebra of a skew PBW extension. Finally, we establish conditions for sufficiency to guarantee the property of being skew Calabi-Yau algebra over skew PBW extensions."
