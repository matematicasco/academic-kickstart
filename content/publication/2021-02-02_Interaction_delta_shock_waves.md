abstract = "In this work, the mechanism for the formation of the delta shock wave is analyzed to deal with interaction of delta shock waves and contact discontinuities for a system of Keyfitz–Kranzer type by means of analysis and solutions of Riemann problems. A set of numerical experiments are provided, illustrating the theoretical findings numerically. A brief survey of the Keyfitz–Kranzer systems as a base model of fundamental nonlinear phenomena in applications is provided aiming to shed light on the intricate wave structure for other related models of conservation laws appearing in applied sciences."
