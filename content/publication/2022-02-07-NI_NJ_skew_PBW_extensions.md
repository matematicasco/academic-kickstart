abstract = "We establish necessary or sufficient conditions to guarantee that skew Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt extensions are NI or NJ rings. Our results extend those corresponding for skew polynomial rings and establish similar properties for other families of noncommutative rings such as universal enveloping algebras and examples of differential operators."
