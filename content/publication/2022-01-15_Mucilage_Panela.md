abstract = "Non-centrifugal cane sugar (NCS) is the second most important Colombian agribusiness in social importance. However, the sugar cane industry is facing some challenges caused by the controversial nutritional and safety attributes of NCS. Some Colombian NCS producers employ natural mucilages as clarifiers; but the uncontrolled application of these components has caused a risk of extinction in the mucilage source plants. Other producers employ acrylamide as a clarifier. Health consequences have generated concerns from the consumers and demanded control from the food authorities. Efforts are being made to develop a standard manufacturing methodology to increase NCS productivity and improve its quality, hygiene, and storability. The application of better clarifiers, which provide the best clarifying activity and minimize the toxicity while conserving NCS's natural attributes, is one of the outstanding challenges as well. This study is a proposal which looks for sustainable, natural, nontoxic, and economical clarifiers for the Colombian NCS producers."
