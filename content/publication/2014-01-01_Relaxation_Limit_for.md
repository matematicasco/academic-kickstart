abstract = "We study the relaxation limit for the Aw-Rascle system of traffic flow. For thiswe apply the theory of invariant regions and the compensated compactnessmethod to get global existence of Cauchy problem for a particular Aw-Rascle system with source, where the source is the relaxation term, and we show the convergence of this solutions to the equilibrium state."
