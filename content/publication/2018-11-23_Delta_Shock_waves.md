abstract = "This paper is concerned with a hyperbolic system of conservation laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type. We show the existence of a delta shock wave solution using the vanishing viscosity method. The obtained solution satisfies the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and the entropy condition. As a consequence, we have also a uniqueness result for the obtained solution."
