abstract = "In this contribution, we extend the concept of coherent pair for two quasi-definite matrix linear functionals $u_{0}$  and $u_{1}$. Necessary and sufficient conditions for these functionals to constitute a coherent pair are determined, when one of them satisfies a matrix Pearson-type equation. Moreover, we deduce algebraic properties of the matrix orthogonal polynomials associated with the Sobolev-type inner product $$<p,q>_{s} = <p,q>_{\\mathbf{u}_0} +  <p'\\mathbf{M}_1,q'\\mathbf{M}_2>_{\\mathbf{u}_1},$$ where $\\mathbf{M}_1$ and $\\mathbf{M}_2$ are non-singular matrices  $p$ and $q$ are matrix polynomials."
