abstract = "We consider the generalized Riemann problem for the Suliciu re- laxation system in Lagrangian coordinates and we calculate the first-order ex- pansion given by LeFloch and Raviart to verify our results, then we show the explicit solution for the generalized Riemann problem in Eulerian coordinates, which has a similar structure as the classical Riemann problem."
