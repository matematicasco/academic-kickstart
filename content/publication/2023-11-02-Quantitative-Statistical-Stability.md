abstract = "We consider a class of endomorphisms that contains a set of piecewise partially hyperbolic dynamics semi-conjugated to non-uniformly expanding maps. Our goal is to study a class of endomorphisms that preserve a foliation that is almost everywhere uniformly contracted, with possible discontinuity sets parallel to the contracting direction. We apply the spectral gap property and the $\\zeta$-HÃ¶lder regularity of the disintegration of its equilibrium states to prove a quantitative statistical stability statement. More precisely, under deterministic perturbations of the system of size $\delta$, we show that the $F$-invariant measure varies continuously with respect to a suitable anisotropic norm. Furthermore, we establish that certain interesting classes of perturbations exhibit a modulus of continuity estimated by $D_2\\delta^{\zeta}\log{\delta}$, where $D_2$ is a constant."
