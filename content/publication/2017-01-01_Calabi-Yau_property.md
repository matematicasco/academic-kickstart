abstract = "Graded skew PBW extensions were defined by the first author as a generalization of graded iterated Ore extensions [36]. The purpose of this paper is to study the Artin-Schelter regularity and the (skew) Calabi- Yau condition for this kind of extensions. We prove that every graded quasi- commutative skew PBW extension of an Artin-Schelter regular algebra is also an Artin-Schelter regular algebra and, as a consequence, every graded quasi- commutative skew PBW extension of a connected skew Calabi-Yau algebra is skew Calabi-Yau. Finally, we prove that graded skew PBW extensions of a finitely presented connected Auslander-regular algebra are skew Calabi-Yau."
