abstract = "In this chapter, we study the one-dimensional Riemann problem for a hyperbolic system of three conservation laws of temple class. Under suitable generalized Rankineâ€“Hugoniot relation and entropy condition, both existence and uniqueness of particular delta-shock type solutions are established. Moreover, we show explicitly the solution of generalized Riemann problem."
