abstract = "We obtain a generalization of Buzano’s inequality of vectors in Hilbert spaces, using the theory of algebraic probability spaces. In particular, we extend a result of Dragomir given in [7]. Applications for numerical inequalities for $n$ - tuples of bounded linear operators and functions of operators defined by double power series are also generalized."
