abstract = "Pre-Koszul and Koszul algebras were defined by Priddy [15]. There exist some relations between these algebras and the skew PBW extensions defined in [8]. In [24] we gave conditions to guarantee that skew PBW extensions over fields it turns out homogeneous pre-Koszul or Koszul algebra. In this paper we complement these results defining graded skew PBW extensions and showing that if R is a finite presented Koszul ùïÇ-algebra then every graded skew PBW extension of R is Koszul."
