abstract = "The *Hosoya triangle* is a triangular array where every entry is a product of two Fibonacci numbers. We use the geometry of this triangle to find new identities related to Fibonacci numbers. We give geometric interpretation for some well-known identities of Fibonacci numbers. For instance, the Cassini identity and the Catalan identity. We also extend some identities that hold in the Pascal triangle to the Hosoya triangle. For example, the hockey stick extends from binomials to products of Fibonacci numbers and the rhombus property extends a binomial identity from the Pascal triangle to an identity of products of Fibonacci numbers in the Hosoya triangle."
