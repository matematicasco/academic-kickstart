abstract = "We define two types of second-order polynomial sequences. A sequence is of Fibonacci-type (Lucas-type) if its Binet formula is similar in structure to the Binet formula for the Fibonacci (Lucas) numbers. Familiar examples are Fibonacci polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials, Morgan-Voyce polynomials, Lucas polynomials, Pell polynomials, Fermat polynomials, Jacobsthal polynomials, Vieta polynomials and other known sequences of polynomials. <br>We generalize the numerical recurrence relation given by Hosoya to polynomials by constructing a Hosoya triangle for polynomials where each entry is either a product of two polynomials of Fibonacci-type or a product of two polynomials of Lucas-type. For every such choice of polynomial sequence we obtain a triangular array of polynomials. In this paper we extend the star of David property, also called the Hoggatt-Hansell identity, to these types of triangles. In addition, we study other geometric patterns in these triangles and as a consequence we obtain geometric interpretations for the Cassini identity, the Catalan identity, and other identities for Fibonacci polynomials."
