abstract = "In [6] was proved that if R is a principal ideal domain and N ⊂ M are submodules of R[x1, . . . , xn]s, then the primary decomposition for N in M can be computed using Gröbner bases. In this paper we extend this result to Dedekind domains. The procedure that computed the primary decomposition is illustrated with an example."
