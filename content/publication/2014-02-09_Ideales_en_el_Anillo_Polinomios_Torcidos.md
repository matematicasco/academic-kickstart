abstract = "This article aims to present the Hilbertâ€™s Basis Theorem for an skew polynomials ring, some classes of ideals that are defined in this ring, and the neccesary conditions for an skew polynomials ring to be semiprimitive. Moreover, some examples for the definitions are provided for its better understanding. The proofs of the results in this article are detailed versions of those obtained from the bibliographical references."
