abstract = "Let $\\mathbf{k}$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic, and let $\\Lambda$ be a finite dimensional $\\mathbf{k}$-algebra. In this short note we prove that if $V$ is a finitely generated strongly Gorenstein-projective left $\\Lambda$-module whose stable endomorphism ring $\\underline{\\mathrm{End}}\_{\\Lambda}(V)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbf{k}$, then $V$ has an universal deformation ring $R(\\Lambda,V)$ isomorphic to the ring of dual numbers $\\mathbf{k}[\\epsilon]$ with $\\epsilon^2=0$. As a consequence, we obtain the following result. Assume that $Q$ is a finite connected acyclic quiver, let $\\mathbf{k} Q$ be the corresponding path algebra and let $\\Lambda = \\mathbf{k} Q[\\epsilon] = \\mathbf{k} Q\\otimes\_{\\mathbf{k}} \\mathbf{k}[\\epsilon]$. If $V$ is a finitely generated Gorenstein-projective left $\\Lambda$-module with $\\underline{\\mathrm{End}}\_{\\Lambda}(V)=\\mathbf{k}$, then $V$ has an universal deformation ring $R(\\Lambda,V)$ isomorphic to $\\mathbf{k}[\\epsilon]."
