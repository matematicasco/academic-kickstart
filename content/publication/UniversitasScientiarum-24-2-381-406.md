abstract = "The main goal of this article is to study a new class of nonlocal operators and the Cauchy problem for certain parabolic-type pseudodifferential equations naturally associated with them. The fundamental solutions of these equations are transition functions of Markov processes on an n-dimensional vector space over the p-adic numbers. We also study some properties of these Markov processes, including the first passage time problem."
