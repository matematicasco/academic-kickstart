abstract = "Mathematical models provide information about population dynamics under different conditions. In the study, four models were evaluated and employed to describe the growth kinetics of *Nostoc ellipsosporum* with different light wavelengths: Baranyi-Roberts, Modiﬁed Gompertz, Modiﬁed Logistic, and Richards. *N. ellipsosporum* was grown in BG-11 liquid medium for 9 days, using 12 hours of photoperiod and the following treatments: white light (400-800 nm), red light (650-800 nm), yellow light (550-580 nm) and blue light (460-480 nm). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The optical density (OD) was measured on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, using a spectrophotometer at 650 nm. The maximum cell growth was obtained under white light (OD650 : 0.090 $\\pm$ 0.008), followed by the yellow light (OD650 :0.057 $\\pm$ 0.004). Conversely, blue light showed a marked inhibitory effect on the growth of *N. ellipsosporum* (OD650 : 0.009 $\\pm$ 0.001). The results revealed that the Baranyi-Roberts model had a better ﬁt with the experimental data from *N. ellipsosporum* growth in all four treatments. The ﬁndings from this modeling study could be used in several biotechnological applications that require the productionof *N. ellipsosporum* and its bioproducts."
