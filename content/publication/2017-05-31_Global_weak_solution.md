abstract = "In this paper we consider the Cauchy problem for a particular non-symmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer type system, by using the vanishing viscosity method coupled with the compensated compactness method we get global bounded entropy weak solutions. The main difficulty is to get uniformly bounded estimates on the viscosity method."
