abstract = "The existence of global BV solutions for the Aw-Rascle system with linear damping is considered. In order to get approximate solutions we consider the system in Lagrangian coordinates, then by using the wave front tracking method coupling with and suitable splitting algorithm and the ideas of [1] we get a sequence of approximate solutions. Finally we show the convergence of this approximate sequence to the weak entropic solution."
