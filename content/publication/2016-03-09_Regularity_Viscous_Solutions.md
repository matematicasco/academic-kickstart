abstract = "We consider the Cauchy problem for a class of nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation with forcing. By using the vanishing viscosity method it is possible to construct a generalized solution. Moreover, this solution is a Lipschitz function on the spatial variable and Hölder continuous with exponent 1/2 on the temporal variable."
