abstract = "We study the one-dimensional Riemann problem for a hyperbolic system of three conservation laws of Temple class. The system is a simplification of a recently proposed system of five conservations laws by Bouchut and Boyaval that models viscoelastic fluids. An important issue is that the considered 3x3 system is such that every characteristic field is linearly degenerate. We study theRiemann problemfor this system and under suitable generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition, both existence and uniqueness of particular delta shock type solutions are established."
