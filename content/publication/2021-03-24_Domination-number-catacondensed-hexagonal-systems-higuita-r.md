abstract = "In this paper we answer all the conjectures about the domination number of a catacondensed hexagonal system given in *Automated Conjecturing VI: Domination Number of Benzenoids*. Moreover, we give lower bounds for the domination number in catacondensed hexagonal systems using the number of hexagons and the number of branching hexagons."
