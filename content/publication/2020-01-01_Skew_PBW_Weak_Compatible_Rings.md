abstract = "In this paper, we introduce weak (Σ,Δ)-compatible rings and study skew Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt extensions over these rings. We characterize the weak notion of compatibility for several noncommutative rings appearing in noncommutative algebraic geometry and some quantum algebras of theoretical physics. As a consequence of our treatment, we unify and extend results in the literature about Ore extensions and skew PBW extensions over compatible rings."
