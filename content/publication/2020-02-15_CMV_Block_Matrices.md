abstract = "In this contribution, we study the relationship between the CMV block matrices associated with two symmetric positive definite matrix measures supported on the unit circle. We also consider certain transformations of an orthogonality matrix measure supported on the unit circle, and deduce connection formulas for the corresponding orthogonal families and their Verblunsky matrix coefficients."
