abstract = "We consider a robust class of random non-uniformly expanding local homeomorphisms and HÃ¶lder continuous potentials with small variation. For each element of this class we develop the Thermodynamical Formalism and prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states among non-uniformly expanding measures. Moreover, we show that these equilibrium states and the random topological pressure vary continuously in this setting."
