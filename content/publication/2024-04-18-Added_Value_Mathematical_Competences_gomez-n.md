abstract = "**Purpose:** This research aimed to identify the scope of the curricular design, with respect to the development of mathematical competencies evaluated in an internal test at entry (2014) and at the end of undergraduate training (2019), which evidenced the relationship between the competencies evaluated and those addressed during the academic program. <br>**Theoretical framework:** This study used concepts related to added value in education, mathematical thinking and competencies and learning processes in the Colombian context.<br>**Methodology:** The methodology employed is of positivist paradigm, with quantitative approach and non-experimental longitudinal design, applying an evaluation instrument "Eearly alerts", to then correlate these results with the number of credits of mathematical competencies in the academic pensum of the programs.<br>**Recommendations:** This research can be used as an instrument for curricular analysis of the programs studied and is constituted as a tool that contributes to other Higher Education Institutions (HEI).<br>**Practical and social implications of the research:** This research seeks to support curricular analysis and restructuring in the analyzed programs since it could be evidenced that the program that contributed the highest number of students to the very high category in the evaluation of mathematics competencies, which could be related to the number of credits assigned to potentiate this type of competencies.<br>**Originality/Value:** To generate significant learning for the application of diagnostic tests in mathematics competencies, as well as to propitiate spaces for curricular analysis in university contexts."
