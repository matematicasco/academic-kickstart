abstract = "In this paper, we study the Riemann problem for a general variable coefficient Burgers equation with time-dependent damping. We use a nonlinear time-dependent viscosity equation with a similarity variable. Thus, when the viscosity goes to zero, we obtain Riemann solutions to the general variable coefficient Burgers equation with time-dependent damping. Moreover, we use the Laxâ€“Friedrichs scheme to obtain numerical evidence of the Riemann solutions."
