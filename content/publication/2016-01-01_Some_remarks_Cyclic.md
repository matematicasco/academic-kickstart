abstract = "We study the cyclic homology for a class of noncommutative polynomial rings known as skew PBW extensions. We obtain explicit computations for some important families of such extensions over fields. In particular, we consider the cyclic homology of skew PBW extensions of derivation type, certain classes of Ore extensions, operator algebras, difusion algebras, quantum algebras and 3-dimensional skew polynomial algebras."
