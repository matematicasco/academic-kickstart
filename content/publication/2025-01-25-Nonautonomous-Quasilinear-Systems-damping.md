abstract = "In this paper, we study two systems with a time-variable coefficient and general time-gradually-degenerate damping. More explicitly, we construct the Riemann solutions to the time-variable coefficient Zeldovich approximation and time-variable coefficient pressureless gas systems both with general time-gradually-degenerate damping. Applying the method of similar variables and nonlinear viscosity, we obtain classical Riemann solutions and delta shock wave solutions."
