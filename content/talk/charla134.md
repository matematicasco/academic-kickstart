**Resumen**: Let $S \to S'$ be a finite, possibly ramified, cover of closed oriented topological surfaces. A problem which recently has received much attention is how to generate the first homology group of $S$ in terms of 1-cycles supported on elevations of curves on $S′$ via the given covering map. I will explain recent advances (joint work with A. Putman and N. Salter) and a connection with the problem of extending finite group actions from surfaces to handlebodies (joint work with E. Samperton and C. Segovia).
