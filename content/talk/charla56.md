**Resumen**: In the theory of Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory, the Thermodynamic Formalism is one of the main topics. For example, we are interested in special types of measures. Among these special types of measures are the Equilibrium States. The study of equilibrium states search for maps and potentials for which we have existence and uniqueness.
In this work, we give a class of hyperbolic potentials for which we have existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states, in the context of continuous non-uniformly expanding maps. Among the maps considered is the class known as Viana maps and among the potentials is the null one, that provides existence and uniqueness of maximal entropy measure.
