**Resumen**: This talk presents a comprehensive analysis of distinct categories of error-correcting codes. It begins by elucidating the concept of linear codes over the Eisenstein field through Short exact sequence(SES). Subsequently, the study delves into cyclic codes over the Eisenstein Field, exploring their unique properties and benefits. Furthermore, examines the Eisenstein Field extension, shedding light on its significance in coding theory. Additionally, the application of BCH codes over the Eisenstein Fields is explored, high lighting their effectiveness in error detection and correction. By providing insights into these various coding techniques, it contributes to a deeper understanding of error-correcting strategies with in the context of the Eisenstein Field and its extensions.
