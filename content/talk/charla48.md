**Resumen**: Although macrophages are part of the human immune system, it has been remarkably observed in laboratory experiments that decreasing its number can slow down the tumor progression. We analyze through a recently mathematical model proposed in the literature, necessary conditions for aggregation of tumor cells and macrophages. In order to do so, we prove the possibility of having blow-up in finite time. Next, we study if the aggregation of macrophages can occur when having a low density of tumor cells, and vice versa. With this purpose, we consider the problem of analyzing the existence or not of a simultaneous blow-up. We achieve this goal thanks to a novel process that allows us to compare the entropy functional associated with the density of each population, which turns out to be also a method to find enough conditions for having a simultaneous blow-up.
