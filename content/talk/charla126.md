**Lugar:** C-119

**Resumen**: In this talk we present some theoretical results about the SAGBI bases (Subalgebras Analogue Gröbner Basis Ideal) for the family of noncommutative rings of polynomial type known as skew Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt extensions. We illustrate our results with several examples appearing in representation theory, quantum groups, noncommutative algebraic geometry and different algebras in theoretical physics. These results are joint with Armando Reyes.
