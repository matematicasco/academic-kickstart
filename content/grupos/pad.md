From the latest models of galaxy formation and evolution, it is
becoming clear that there is a more fundamental distinction in the
galaxy population than the usual classification: elliptical vs. spiral
galaxies. The striking difference between elliptical and spiral
galaxies is a result of variation in the relative visual prominence of
the spheroid and disk components. However, measuring the properties of
the single components within a galaxy is considerably more difficult
than measuring its overall properties. Galaxies are complex structures
and, beyond the general distinction between spheroids and disks, they
display a range of higher level features; in addition to spiral arms,
these include bars, rings, etc. These complexities make it difficult
for computational methods to extract meaningful information.

 **MegaMorph** tackles this problem by utilizing the full set of
multi-color information available for each galaxy and applying a
variety of novel techniques. We are developing efficient algorithms
capable of robustly measuring the properties of the internal
components of tens of thousands of galaxies. It is central to our
goals that we produce tools that we can put to practical scientific use, both by ourselves, but also by the wider astronomical community.

The software developed by **MegaMorph**: **GALFITM** and **GALAPAGOS-2**, are now
publicly available from the [projectâ€™s homepage][megamorph].
